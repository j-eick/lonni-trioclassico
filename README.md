# trio classico

This is a little project work for a musician friend and I am using this opportunity to test **cursor.ai** and see if it does what it promises.
<br><br>
Opinion so far: **3.5 / 5** <br><br>
While not too shabby, there's a noticeable amount of unnecessary code generated. Cleaning that up via prompts doesn't work reliably. For more complex code gpt `o3-mini-high` does a pretty good job, compared to `Claude Sonnet 3.5`.

Tech-Stack:

-   react, bun, tailwind 3.4.14, typescript
-   cursor.ai
